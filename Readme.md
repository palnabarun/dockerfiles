* Dockerfile Repository

This repository stores the dockerfiles that I use. These dockerfiles are
experimental as of now and lack many libraries which are
essential for deep-learning.

** To-Do

- Add volume in `Dockerfile.gpu` to mount the current host directory to `/notebook` by default
- Add OpenCV to the image

** Contributing

Suggestions are welcome for including more packages in the image.
